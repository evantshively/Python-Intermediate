Notebook Concepts:

Data Persistance:
    pickle, shelves, and database[sqlite]

Object Serialization:
    pickle module under python implements a powerful algorithm
    for serialization and de-serialization of a data structure.
    Serialization - Helps with Construct, transfer and De-Contruct of data

Which Objects can you Pickle: 
    Booleans, Integers, Floats, Complex Numbers, String, Tuples, Lists,
    Sets, and Dictionaries 

In place of Pickle some people use a JSon Object (JavaScript Object Notation)

'''

import pickle as pk 

print("Pickling Lists")

variety = ["hot", "dill"]
shape = ["whole", "spear"]
brand = ["Heinz", "Vlassic"]

file = open("pickles.dat", "wb") #wb means write binary
pk.dump(variety, file)
pk.dump(shape, file)
pk.dump(brand, file) #dump function populates the list 
file.close() # This will creaâ€ e a serialized  

# this created a serialized folder in the same directory as our saved code
# this new file is called pickle.dat



''' How to unPickle the pickled object

Organization structure used here is called
FIFO: First in First Out

Because of this concept of FIFO you want to make sure to put
import Data first in your serialization structure

Data is hashed through pickle. Pickle In and Pickle Out


'''

import pickle as pk
print("Unpickle Lists")

file = open("pickles.dat", "rb") #rb means read binary

data1 = pk.load(file)
data2 = pk.load(file)
data3 = pk.load(file)

print(data1) 
print(data2)
print(data3)


''' 

Additional Examples 
Pickling a text file

'''

import pickle as pk

print("pickling text file")

# this function uses the with command this opens in safe mode 
# it opens and closes the file within the block of the code
# this skips the step of using the close() command 

myList = ["I wish upon a star. I love python. Shakespeare wrote Romeo and Juliet"]
with open("shakespeare.pkl", "wb") as file:
    pk.dump(myList, file)

# never name a file similar to an object 
# this can cause issues with your coding and importing
# one way to remedy this is to use upper case letters in your file name

''' Unpickle the text file '''

import pickle

with open("shakespeare.pkl", 'rb') as file:
    myNewList = pickle.load(file)

print(myNewList)

'''

Multiprocessing is a form of Complex Computation
Its' main purpose is to save time

When Complex computations have to be executed, it is common to distribute this
task over several processes.

Multiprocessing means several processes are executed simultaneously, 
Usually over several CPUs or CPU Cores. 

This is a basic program for multiprocessing:

-----------

multiprocessing as mp, and cos from math. 
We will create a Pool abstraction, you can specify the amount of processors to use.
The Pool can handle the multiprocessing in the background.

cos function on a range is used to invoke the number of Pools for MultiThreading

Lambda functions cannot be used in Pickles

'''

import multiprocessing as mp
from math import cos  #coSign

#IMPORTANT
#IMPORTANT this is a lot of processing and can crash your computer

#p = mp.Pool(2)
#p.map(cos, range(2)) 
# Code is set as a comment for safety
