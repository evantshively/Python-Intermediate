variety = ["hot", "dill"]

brand = ["Heinz", "Vlassic"]

file = open("pickles.dat", "wb") #wb means write binary
pk.dump(variety, file)
pk.dump(shape, file)
pk.dump(brand, file) #dump function populates the list 
file.close() # This will creaâ€ e a serialized  

# this created a serialized folder in the same directory as our saved code
# this new file is called pickle.dat
