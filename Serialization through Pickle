Notebook Concepts:

Data Persistance:
    pickle, shelves, and database[sqlite]

Object Serialization:
    pickle module under python implements a powerful algorithm
    for serialization and de-serialization of a data structure.
    Serialization - Helps with Construct, transfer and De-Contruct of data
'''

import pickle as pk 

print("Pickling Lists")

variety = ["hot", "dill"]
shape = ["whole", "spear"]
brand = ["Heinz", "Vlassic"]

file = open("pickles.dat", "wb") #wb means write binary
pk.dump(variety, file)
pk.dump(shape, file)
pk.dump(brand, file) #dump function populates the list 
file.close() # This will creaâ€ e a serialized  

# this created a serialized folder in the same directory as our saved code
# this new file is called pickle.dat



''' How to unPickle the pickled object

Organization structure used here is called
FIFO: First in First Out

Because of this concept of FIFO you want to make sure to put
import Data first in your serialization structure

Data is hashed through pickle. Pickle In and Pickle Out


'''

import pickle as pk
print("Unpickle Lists")

file = open("pickles.dat", "rb") #rb means read binary

data1 = pk.load(file)
data2 = pk.load(file)
data3 = pk.load(file)

print(data1) 
print(data2)
print(data3)
