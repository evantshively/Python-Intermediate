'''
For this code project we grabbed a random image of a dog from the internet and saved is as dog.jpg in the same folder as our py module code

'''

import io 

with open("dog.jpg", 'rb') as imgFile:  
    jpgData = imgFile.read()

# print(jpgData)
# This gives us a bunch of byte characters that make up the image 

if jpgData.startswith(b'\xff\xd8'):
    text = u'This is a JPEG file (%d bytes long)\n'
else:
    text = u'This is a random file (%d bytes long)\n'

with open("summary.txt", 'w', encoding='utf-8') as outFile:
    outFile.write(text % len(jpgData))
