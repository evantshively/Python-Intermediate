	#print square (Def = defintion) when you hit enter after a : it automatically goes 4 space
	#this is a key indication technique in Python
	#received_value an object for calculations int = integer 
	#get_json parses the data as JSON JSON format is JavaScript Object Notation
	# return is showing that we are squaring the integer by 2

#Route is the path you want your application information to be sent to 
#Line five is showing were we are directing our information
#in adding predict after the route we are changing the endpoint
#predict is the subdomain we are setting 
#Default is always GET unless you change, the next line after the comma changes this to something else i.e POST
#What happens? The function that follows happens 
#16 is show us our main entrypoint in which to run the app 
#this code is an example of how to organize proper code 
#host is showing us where the IP address is we are running this 
#for local host always use 0.0.0.0
